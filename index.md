## What is an NHS Number?

The NHS Number is a single patient identifier used across the NHS in England and Wales. 

In 2015, the NHS Number was legally mandated to be used as a single patient identifier across health and care with the introduction of the [The Health and Social Care (Safety and Quality) Bill](https://www.digitalhealth.net/2015/10/nhs-number-use-becomes-law/).

Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar single patient idenfifiers on which there is more information below.


## Using the NHS number within services and systems

The use of the NHS number in health and care organisations is specified in an the [Information Standards Board](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards) standard [ISB 0149 NHS Number](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/isb-0149-nhs-number)
