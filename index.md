## What is an NHS Number?

The NHS Number is a single patient identifier used across the NHS in England and Wales. 

In 2015, the NHS Number was legally mandated to be used as a single patient identifier across health and care with the introduction of the [The Health and Social Care (Safety and Quality) Bill](https://www.digitalhealth.net/2015/10/nhs-number-use-becomes-law/).

Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar single patient idenfifiers on which there is more information below.
